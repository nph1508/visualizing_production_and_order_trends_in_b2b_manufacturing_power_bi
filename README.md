## 1. üìå Background & Overview 

**Objective:**

**üìñ What is this project about?**

This project analyzes purchasing activities at **AdventureWorks** to support better operational decisions. The Power BI dashboard focuses on:

- **Manufactoring Performance**: Track production status to facilitate storage and distribution to customers. 
- **Optimization**: During the warehouse inspection process, there is a possibility that goods will be damaged, and will be rejected to ensure that only quality products are stored for sale.

**üë§ Who is this project for?**

This dashboard is designed for key stakeholders involved in the manufactoring process at **AdventureWorks**, including:

 - **Manufactoring Manager**: To monitor supplier performance, order fulfillment, and spot procurement issues early.  
- **Manufactoring Executive**: To track purchasing KPIs, ensure compliance with procurement strategies, and manage day-to-day operations efficiently.  
- **Board of Directors (BOD)**: To gain high-level insights into purchasing efficiency and cost control for strategic decision-making.

**‚ùìBusiness Questions:**
 - ‚úîÔ∏è What is the current performance of Superstore?
 - ‚úîÔ∏è Which markets should Superstore expand into to increase revenue and ROI?
 - ‚úîÔ∏è Which products should be prioritized for strategic growth?

## 4. üìä Key Insights & Visualizations 
### üîç Dashboard Preview 
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Page 1: Manufacturing Overview Dashboard  
<img width="2767" height="1600" alt="Visualizing Production   Order Trends in B2B Manufacturing-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b762c0b-857a-4be9-8973-9729a6542ae7" />

#### **1. Total Orders & Scrap Rate**
- The total production volume reached **4.5 million units**, with only **11K units scrapped**, accounting for just **0.24%**, indicating excellent production efficiency.
- The **highest scrap rate** occurred in **2013** at **0.29%**, which coincided with the **peak in order volume (1.91M)**‚Äîsuggesting a potential correlation between high volume and increased quality risk.

#### **2. Delivery Performancer**
- On-time deliveries increased significantly from **2011** to **2013**, peaking at **1.9M on-time orders** in 2013.
- However, in 2014, both total orders and on-time deliveries dropped sharply to **0.9M**, hinting at either declining demand or reduced production capacity.

#### **3. Manufacturing Time & Cost**
- The **most expensive stages** in the process are **Frame Forming ($92.25)** and **Frame Welding ($87.5)**, representing the largest cost centers in production.
- **Debur and Polish** is the **least costly stage ($14)**, yet it experienced a notable **increase in working hours from 6K to 20K** between 2011 and 2014.

#### **4. Total Working Hours by Production Stage**
- **2013** marked the peak in labor demand, with **Frame Forming (37K)** and **Frame Welding (31K)** recording the highest working hours.
- Stages such as **Specialized Paint** and **Subassembly** showed minimal to no activity across the years, possibly indicating process optimization or phase-outs.

#### **5. Top 5 Most Manufactured Products**
- BB Ball Bearing led production with **0.91M units**, nearly **double** the second-most produced item (**Seat Stays ‚Äì 0.47M**).
- Remaining products **like Blade**, **Fork End**, and **Chain Stays** each stayed below **0.25M units**, suggesting a strong production focus on a few key items.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Page 2: Scrap Products 
 <img width="2767" height="1600" alt="Visualizing Production   Order Trends in B2B Manufacturing-2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e422f33b-6e41-4720-b0f2-080fa2b85598" />

### üìå Key Findings:

#### **1. Scrap Rate Trends Over Time**
- Scrap rate rose steadily from **0.13%** (**2011**) to a peak of **0.29%** (**2013**), before dropping to **0.19%** in **2014**, indicating an improvement in quality control efforts.
- Compared to the previous year, 2014 shows a clear downward trend, suggesting corrective actions were likely effective.

#### **2. Top Scrap Reasons**
- The most common cause of scrap is ‚Äú**Seat assembly not as ordered**‚Äù, with the highest scrap rate at **3.14%**.
- Other significant reasons include ‚Äú**Drill size too large**‚Äù (**2.92%**), ‚Äú**Paint process failed**‚Äù (**2.90%**), and ‚Äú**Trim length too long**‚Äù (**2.88%**) ‚Äî all pointing to assembly and process precision issues.

#### **3. Scrap Rate by Product**
- **ML Road Frame** has the highest scrap rate at **0.75%**, followed by **Mountain Frame (0.63%)** and **HL Touring Frame (0.61%)**.
- This suggests a need to revisit design tolerances or process consistency for larger frame-type products.

#### **4. Scrap Cost Analysis**
- The total scrap cost reached **$360K**, with the top reasons being:
 - **Color incorrect** ($36.23K)
 - **Trim length too long** ($34.91K)
 - **Thermoform temperature too high** ($33.21K)
- This indicates that** material quality control and finishing processes** are areas with high cost impact.

#### **5. Scrap Cost by Products**
- The product with the highest scrap cost is **ML Crankset**, totaling **$26K**, significantly ahead of others.
- Other products like **Touring Rear Wheel**, **ML Mountain Front Wheel**, and **LL Fork** follow with scrap costs around **$9K each**, indicating moderate but consistent quality challenges across multiple product lines.

#### **6. Product & Reason Cross-analysis**
- **BB Ball Bearing**, despite being the most produced item, has **multiple reasons for scrap**, such as:
  - **Handling damage (36)**
  - **Brake assembly not as ordered (35)**
  - **Drill size too small (30)**
- Although the scrap quantity for each issue is low, the diversity of causes suggests potential for process tightening.

 <img width="2767" height="1600" alt="Visualizing Production   Order Trends in B2B Manufacturing-3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a6ef9c0-9302-4bd6-82dc-875583cd10db" />

### üìå Key Findings:

#### **1. Overall Manufacturing Time Performance**
- The **average actual manufacturing time** is **12 days**, slightly longer than the **scheduled 11 days**, showing mild delays across operations.
- Similarly, **average manufacturing hours** stand at **297 hours**, reflecting a consistent workload across production.

#### **2. Delivery Timeliness**
- The overall **late delivery ratio** is high at **58%**, with **27.9K orders delivered late** out of **73K total work orders**.
- While more than half of the orders were on time, the high late ratio suggests systemic bottlenecks or planning inefficiencies.

#### **3. Manufacturing Delay by Product**
- Several products show **consistently high actual manufacturing days** (**16 days**) ‚Äî including:
 - **ML Mountain Frame - Black**
 - **ML Mountain Handlebars**
 - **ML Mountain Seat Assembly**
- These items may be more complex or resource-intensive, driving longer production cycles.

#### **4. Stage-Level Delays**
- Every production stage exceeds the planned 11 days, with **Specialized Paint** and **Debur and Polish** taking **13 days**, representing the largest overruns.
- The smallest delay gap is in **Subassembly**, **Frame Forming**, and **Frame Welding** (12 actual vs 11 scheduled).

#### **5. Late Delivery Ratio by Stage Over Time**
- The **worst-performing stages** in 2011 were **Debur and Polish** (**77%**) and **Final Assembly** (**76%**) late ratios.
- By 2014, improvements were evident, but **most stages still had 58‚Äì61% late deliveries**, showing gradual but incomplete progress in on-time performance.

#### **6. Products with Most Overdue Days**
- The top delayed product is **Mountain-500 Black**, with an average of **10.8 overdue days**, followed closely by **Road-750 Black** (**10.7 days**) and **Mountain-400-W** (**10.5 days**).
- All **top 10 delayed products** exceed **10 days overdue on average**, highlighting recurring issues in specific SKUs.

## 5. üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendations

üëâüèª Based on the OEE and quality analysis, we recommend the **Production Leadership Team** to prioritize these actions:  

üìå **Key Takeaways:**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Immediate Quality Intervention**  
- Address paint process failures (32% of scrap) through equipment calibration and operator retraining  
- Implement mandatory drill size checks for HL Mountain Frame line (57.8% defect correlation)  

‚úîÔ∏è **OEE Improvement Plan**  
- Replicate Road-150 production methods (90.17% OEE) to underperforming lines  
- Focus on location with 19% OEE through cross-training and process benchmarking  

‚úîÔ∏è **Downtime Reduction**  
- Schedule preventive maintenance during low season (July trend dip)  
- Optimize HL Mountain Frame assembly (129,168h downtime) using Lean methodologies  

> üöÄ **Next Steps:** Establish a 30-60-90 day action plan with weekly OEE tracking and scrap rate alerts
